# Tigers Pitching Scouting Report

This project generates scouting reports for Detroit Tigers pitchers using Statcast data.

## Features
- Written in **RMarkdown**
- Outputs **PDF reports**
- Includes pitch arsenal summaries, strikeout tendencies, heatmaps, and platoon splits

## Example
ðŸ“„ See the example report: [pitcher_report_template.pdf]

## How to Run
1. Open `Full_Team_Scouting_Report_Loop.R` in RStudio  
2. Make sure `pitcherdata24.rds` is in the same folder, as well as `pitcher_report_template.Rmd`
3. I am not attaching my .rds file as it is to big, but the code of how I got the data is below
4. Run the first 10 lines first, if this gives you an error it is because you need to install those libraries through `install.packages()`
5. Once that is done run the rest of the code and it should generate scouting report for each pitcher in the destination that you choose, 
	see `output_dir <- "D:/Baseball/Scouting Reports"` (this is where it defaults for me)

## About
Built by Alan Anderson as a demonstration of automated scouting report generation for MLB front office applications.





## RDS Code

# Sequence of Ranges
start_dates <- seq(as.Date("2024-03-28"), as.Date("2024-09-30"), by = "5 days")
end_dates <- pmin(start_dates + 4, as.Date("2024-09-30"))

# Initialize List to Store Results
all_pitch_data24 <- list()

# Loop Over Date Ranges
for(i in seq_along(start_dates)) {
  message("Querying: ", start_dates[i], " to ", end_dates[i])
# rate limit to avoid over loading the server(line below this statement)
  Sys.sleep(3)
  data <- statcast_search_pitchers(
    start_date = start_dates[i],
    end_date = end_dates[i]
  )
  
  all_pitch_data24[[i]] <- data
}

# Combine all results
pitcherdata24 <- bind_rows(all_pitch_data24)

# Now Manipulate the Data
pitcherdata24 <- pitcherdata24 %>%
  mutate(
    pitcher_team = ifelse(inning_topbot == "Top", home_team, away_team)
  )

saveRDS(pitcherdata24, file = "D:/Baseball/pitcherdata24.rds")
